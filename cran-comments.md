## Resubmission

This is a resubmission to fix backend service urls that have been migrated to the cloud.

## Test environments

devtools::check and devtools::check_win_release passed.

## R CMD check results

There were no NOTEs or WARNINGs.

There is an ERORR pertaining to a test, however the test is skipped on CRAN and should not present an issue. As this package is an API wrapper, many tests do not pass.
