\usage{
npn_get_data(
  url,
  query,
  download_path = NULL,
  always_append = FALSE,
  six_leaf_raster = NULL,
  six_bloom_raster = NULL,
  agdd_layer = NULL,
  additional_layers = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The URL of the service endpoint to request data from}

\item{download_path}{String, optional file path to the file for which to
output the results.}

\item{always_append}{Boolean flag. When set to true, then we always append
data to the download path. This is used in the case of npn_get_data_by_year
where we're making multiple requests to the same service and aggregating
all data results in a single file. Without this flag, otherwise, each call
to the service would truncate the output file.}
}
\value{
Data table of the requested data. NULL if a download_path was
specified.
